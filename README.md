My work with `sharp`.

To work you need to create `images` and `processed_images` inside your project folder.

To run, use `node _image_process.js`.

Requare `Node-API v9 compatible runtime e.g. Node.js >= 18.17.0`:

Also for `win` need to install package:
`npm i @img/sharp-win32-x64`

# Install

Run `npm i`
